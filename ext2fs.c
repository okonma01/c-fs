   operations, for the file and all the components of the path.
   
   Parameters:
     path: Path of the file whose metadata is requested.
     stbuf: Pointer to a struct stat where metadata must be stored.

     In case of success, returns 0, and fills the data in stbuf with

/* ext2_readdir: Function called when a process requests the listing

   Parameters:
     path: Path of the directory whose listing is requested.
     buf: Pointer that must be passed as first parameter to filler
          function.
     filler: Pointer to a function that must be called for every entry
             in the directory.  Will accept four parameters, in this
             order: buf (previous parameter), the filename for the
             entry as a string, a pointer to a struct stat containing
             the metadata of the file (optional, may be passed NULL),
             and an offset for the next call to ext2_readdir
             (optional, may be passed 0).
     offset: Will usually be 0. If a previous call to filler for the
             same path passed a non-zero value as the offset, this
             function will be called again with the provided value as
             the offset parameter. Optional.
     fi: Not used in this implementation of readdir.

   Returns:
     In case of success, returns 0, and calls the filler function for
     each entry in the provided directory. If the directory doesn't
     exist, returns -ENOENT.

/* ext2_read: Function called when a process reads data from a file in
   the file system. This function stores, in array 'buf', up to 'size'
   bytes from the file, starting at offset 'offset'. It may store less
   than 'size' bytes only in case of error or if the file is smaller
   than size+offset.
   
   Parameters:
     path: Path of the open file.
     buf: Pointer where data is expected to be stored.
     size: Maximum number of bytes to be read from the file.
     offset: Byte offset of the first byte to be read from the file.
     fi: Data structure containing information about the file being
         opened. Can be ignored in this implementation.
   Returns:
     In case of success, returns the number of bytes actually read
     from the file--which may be smaller than size, or even zero, if
     (and only if) offset+size is beyond the end of the file. In case
     of error, may return one of these error codes (not all of them
     are required):
       -ENOENT: If the file does not exist;
       -EISDIR: If the path corresponds to a directory;
       -EIO: If there was an I/O error trying to obtain the data.

/* ext2_readlink: Function called when FUSE needs to obtain the target of
   a symbolic link. The target is stored in buffer 'buf', which stores
   up to 'size' bytes, as a NULL-terminated string. If the target is
   too long to fit in the buffer, the target should be truncated.
   
   Parameters:
     path: Path of the symbolic link file.
     buf: Pointer where symbolic link target is expected to be stored.
     size: Maximum number of bytes to be stored into the buffer,
           including the NULL byte.
   Returns:
     In case of success, returns 0 (zero). In case of error, may
     return one of these error codes (not all of them are required):
       -ENOENT: If the file does not exist;
       -EINVAL: If the path does not correspond to a symbolic link;
